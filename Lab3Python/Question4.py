#4)Report your views on the k nearest neighbor algorithm when we change the K how it will affect the accuracy.
# Provide a good justification about the changes of the accuracy when we change the amount of K.
# For example: compare the accuracy when K=1 and K is a big number like 50, why the accuracy will change
